## INTRODUCTION

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GSSOC-20-orange?style=for-the-badge">](https://www.gssoc.tech/)<br />
This is a crop advisory app for farmers and gardeners. It can diagnose pest damage, plant disease and nutrient deficiencies that are affecting crops and can offer corresponding treatment measures.

## VISION

The intention of the project is to familiarise the student with open source development in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Android Development. It will be done by making a real-life application that can be used by the consumers. Our aim is to make an end to end crop advisory app for farmers and gardeners. It can diagnose pest damage, plant disease and nutrient deficiencies that are affecting crops and can offer corresponding treatment measures.

## WORKING

This application takes an image of the leaf or crop as input and shows the results. It diagnoses the plant disease, pest damage, nutrient deficiencies and other factors affecting the growth of the crop and offers corresponding treatment measures to cure it. The result will be mainly presented in three categories, which are symptoms, treatments, and recommended products.
