## WORKING

This application takes an image of the leaf or crop as input and shows the results. It diagnoses the plant disease, pest damage, nutrient deficiencies and other factors affecting the growth of the crop and offers corresponding treatment measures to cure it. The result will be mainly presented in three categories, which are symptoms, treatments, and recommended products.
